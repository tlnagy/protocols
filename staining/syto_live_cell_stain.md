# SYTO 11 Staining Protocol

SYTO dyes are green-fluorescent (FITC channel) nucleic acid stains that
are cell permeable and have high differential quantum yields upon nucleic
acid binding[^1].

## Reagent details

- Thermo-fisher Cat. no. S7573
- Ex/Em: 508/527nm (DNA), 510/530nm (RNA)
- QY: 0.49 (DNA), 0.39 (RNA)
- Stock conc: 5mM
- Working conc for eukaryotic: 10nM-5$\mu M$

## Storage

Store 5mM solution in DMSO, upright, at $\leq -20^{\circ}C$ away from
light. Stable for 1+ years.

## Usage

- [ ] Dilute stock 1:1000 -- 1:10,000 in media 
- [ ] Incubate cells for 10-120 minutes
- [ ] Visualize in FITC channel

[^1]: SYTO dyes are not DNA selective, unlike DAPI and Hoechst 33342
